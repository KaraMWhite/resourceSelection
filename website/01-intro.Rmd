This chapter contains details the creation of a relational database as partial fulfillment of the RDS 2023 course requirements. 

## Database Design

Below is an image of the database structure I intend to use to host the data for
my final semester project. The diagram describes the tables that will compose my 
database. Primary keys are in **bold** and foreign keys are in *italics*.

```{r design, fig.align='center', out.width='100%', eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("db_outline.jpg")

```

## Database Construction

```{r}

```
