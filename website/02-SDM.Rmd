# Plains Spotted Skunk Distribution in South Dakota

```{r library, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(DBI)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r flyer, fig.cap = "A 'wanted' flyer created to solicit spotted skunk observations", fig.align='center', out.width='100%', eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

```
I conducted a widespread campaign to solicit plains spotted skunk observations 
in South Dakota. I encouraged respondents to report plains spotted skunk 
observations via phone, email, or online through an iNaturalist project page
that we created to aggregate online reports. Targeted respondents included 
state natural resource managers, academic institutions, furbearer license 
holders and state trapper association members, agricultural landowners, and 
members of various hunting and wildlife-oriented social groups. Information 
appeared in multiple news publications throughout the state, including in print,
online, and over the radio. I also queried the [VertNet](http://vertnet.org/) 
and [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/) 
databases, reviewed published and ongoing wildlife research in South Dakota, 
and accessed data maintained by the South Dakota Game Fish and Parks (SDGFP) 
Natural Heritage Program. Finally, I reviewed information from the South Dakota 
Department of Transportation’s roadkill image database for all roadkill tagged 
as a “small animal.”

I compiled all observations into a table I named "obs". How many observations 
did I collect?
```{r table, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
obs <- dbGetQuery(skunks_db, "SELECT * FROM observations;")
```

```{r n.reports, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

obs %>% 
summarise(obs_id = n())
```
I collected 186 records. Let's see how those records vary by county.

## Spotted skunk locations across the state
```{r pathways, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
path.root <- "C:/Users/Kara.White/OneDrive - South Dakota State University - SDSU/Dissertation - SDSU/SDHM"
path.skunk <- paste(path.root, "/sdhmR-V2022.1/spottedskunk", sep = "")

```

```{r shapefile, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
setwd(path.skunk)
SDak <- sf::st_read(
    './SDCountyBoundaries',
    'County_Boundaries__Census_2010')
# have not been able to get the ../ path functionality to work.

obs_sf <- st_as_sf(obs, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = st_crs(SDak))
```

```{r occurrences by county}

SDak %>% 
  st_join(obs_sf) %>% 
  group_by(NAME) %>% 
  summarize(n_county = n()) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = n_county)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Number of observations", option = "magma") +
  labs(title = "Spotted skunk occurrences by county") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

  
```

We can see that most reported spotted skunk observations were clustered in
eastern South Dakota, and that one county had over 50 observations! That's 
because one trapper provided a lot of data.

## Sources of reported spotted skunk observations

Let's take a look at some of the data providers
```{r sources, warning=FALSE}
obs %>% 
  count(Source) %>% 
  mutate(Source = reorder(Source, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Source, y = n, fill = Source)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Reported spotted skunk observations by source", x = "", 
       y = "Count", 
       fill = "Source") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_light() 
  
```

We can see that trappers provides the majority of spotted skunk observations, 
followed by databases, social media, and prior research.

## Contemporary Data and geographical uncertainty

Some of those records were historical and do not 
match contemporary predictor data which is available from 1970. How many reports
do I have that occurred before 1970?
```{r years, eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
obs %>% 
  tally(Year <= 1970)
```
I have 6 records before 1970, which I want to omit before analyses. We also had 
some locational uncertainty because some trappers provided locations to the 
nearest 1/4 section of a particular township and range rather than specific 
coordinates. I will randomly exclude one location from a pair of records that
occurred closer than the estimated locational threshold to account for potential
duplication of observations and to reduce the effects of spatial autocorrelation. 
```{r rarify}
obs_thin <- obs %>% 
  filter(Year >= 1970 & Year <= 2022) %>% 
  spThin::thin(lat.col = "Latitude", 
               long.col = "Longitude", 
               spec.col = "Species", 
               thin.par = 3, 
               reps = 1, 
               locs.thinned.list.return = T,
               write.files = F) 
  
```
After spatial thinning we have 129 spotted skunk observations that I will use
for analyses. 

## Comparisons of spatial extents and presence:pseudo-absence ratios

Most of the spotted skunk observations are in eastern 
South Dakota. Should I should omit the far western points and 
concentrate my analyses on the eastern part of the state, or retain a statewide
analysis?

Furthermore, while species distribution modeling require presence-only datasets, 
Elith et al. (2006) found that presence-absence models performed better than 
presence-only models, so I want to incorporate pseudo-absences (PsA) into my 
dataset. 

My next step is to generate pseudo-absence (PsA) locations, but there is no 
general consensus on how many to use. 

Well, since the literature doesn't provide clear guidelines, I want to 
explore how various ratios of P:PSA to inform decision making.

Creating a modeling domain and generating PsA's requires a lot of background 
code so I went ahead and created two different modelling domains with two 
different ratios of P:PsA. I've included the code to see what the various 
combinations look like:

```{r datasets, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library(sf)
#read in datasets

  obs.10xPPsA <- read.csv("obs_10xPPsA.csv")

# buffer easter extent by 20km and merge overlapping polygons
  Eobs_bufpts20kmSF <- st_union(st_buffer(obs_E_aea, dist = 20000))

# Create bounding box around buffered pts 
  Eobs_bbox20kmSF <- st_as_sfc(st_bbox(Eobs_bufpts20kmSF)) 

```

```{r plots}

library(patchwork)
(p1 | p3) / (p2 | p4)
```

Now that I have my 4 datasets I am interested in how presences and 
pseudo-absences relate to various climate variables. In order to visualize 
these relationships, I had to extract values from climate rasters 
and match them to each presence and pseudo-absence location.

## Climate data exploration

[WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/data/index.html) provides 
data for various temperature and precipitation measures and elevation.
```{r climate data, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
setwd(path.skunk)
PPsA10x_climate <- read.csv("PPsA10x_climate.csv")
PPsA100x_climate <- read.csv("PPsA100x_climate.csv")
PPsA10xE_climate <- read.csv("PPsA10xE_climate.csv")
PPsA100xE_climate <- read.csv("PPsA100xE_climate.csv")

```
Let's take a look at how some of the climate predictors differ between 
ratios of P:PsAs and modeling domains. 

But, rather than write code to makes plots for each of the four dataframes 
similar to how I did so above, this time I will write a function for boxplot 
comparisons across dataframes.
```{r function}

plots <- function(variable, y_label) {
  data_list <- list(
    PPsA10x = PPsA10x_climate,
    PPsA100x = PPsA100x_climate,
    PPsA10xE = PPsA10xE_climate,
    PPsA100xE = PPsA100xE_climate)
  
  title_list <- c("10x PPsA", "100x PPsA", "10x PPsA East", "100x PPsA East")

  plot_list <- lapply(seq_along(data_list), function(i) {
    ggplot(data_list[[i]], aes(x = factor(pres), y = .data[[variable]])) +
      geom_boxplot() +
      labs(x = "Absence | Presence", y = ifelse(i == 1, y_label, "")) +
      ggtitle(title_list[i]) +
      theme_bw()
  })
  cowplot::plot_grid(plotlist = plot_list, nrow = 1)
}

```

Now I'll use my function called "plots" to make comparisons across dataframes
with various climate variables.

First, let's look at minimum temperature of the coldest month
```{r temp}
plots(variable = "wc2.1_2.5m_bio_11", "Temp Coldest Mo.")
```

From the graph we can see that the average coldest temperature for presence 
locations is slightly colder than the average coldest temperature of 
pseudo-absences. But, when we consider only eastern South Dakota we see that the
relationship switches. Now, the average coldest temperature of presence locations
is slightly warmer than the average coldest temperature of pseudo-absence 
locations.

Let's look at annual precipitation
```{r}
plots(variable = "wc2.1_2.5m_bio_12", "Annual Precip" )
```

Here we can see that when considering only eastern South Dakota, the average
precipitation values for both presences and absences are greater than the
average precipitation values of the entire state. This makes sense because 
eastern South Dakota generally receives much more rain than the west.

Finally, let's take a look at elevation
```{r}
plots(variable = "wc2.1_2.5m_elev", "Elevation")
```

Here we see a similar pattern, When considering all of South Dakota, we notice
that the mean elevation for presences is slightly lower than pseudo-absence 
locations, but the mean value for both presences and pseudo-absences is about 
the same when we restrict locations to eastern South Dakota.


For further exploratory purposes, let's standardize the values of all 20 climate
and elevation predictors and plot them together to see differences. I'll use the
10:1 P:PsA for all of South Dakota.
```{r scaled}

data.frame(cbind(PPsA10x_climate[, 3, drop = F], 
                              scale(PPsA10x_climate[ , 5:24]))) %>% 
pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("wc"), names_to = "variable", 
             values_to = "value") %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = factor(pres), y = value, color = variable)) +  
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), 
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20)) +
  labs(title = "") +
  ylab("Scaled Values") + xlab("") +
  geom_boxplot() +
facet_wrap(~variable, scale = "free")
```

We can see that some variables have greater variation and greater differences 
between presences and pseudo-locations. Twenty variables is a lot, and some of 
these variables are likely correlated. We'll want to take a look at the 
correlations between variables and remove correlated variables that can confound
relationships between the response and predictor variables. Ideally, I want to
aim to retain between 5-10 climate variables.

## Correlations between predictor variables

Let's begin with the 10:1 P:PPsA for all of South Dakota
```{r}
library(corrplot)

vars <- PPsA10x_climate %>% 
  select(6:25) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  corrplot(method = "color",order = "AOE", diag = FALSE, type="lower", tl.col = "black", 
           addCoef.col="black", number.cex=0.50, tl.srt = 25, 
           main = "All Variables", mar=c(0,0,2,0))
  
```

We can see that quite a few of the climate variables are highly correlated.
To help me consider which predictor variables to retain from a set of highly
correlated predictors, I want to evaluate the predictive power of individual 
predictor variables as available in sequence within the dataframe, and then
graph them to make easier comparisons.

```{r VIP, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
varimp.glm <- function(PPsA10x_climate, var.all, pres, pf, pl) {
  tmp.mat <- matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = (pl - pf + 1))
  for (i in pf:pl) {
    tmp <- glm(PPsA10x_climate[, pres] ~ var.all[, i] + I((var.all[, i])^2), 
               na.action = na.omit, family = binomial)
    tmp.mat[(i - pf + 1), 1] <- tmp$aic
    tmp.mat[(i - pf + 1), 2] <- (1 - (tmp$deviance/tmp$null.deviance))
    }
  return(tmp.mat)
} 

PPsA10x_climate$pres <-as.numeric(PPsA10x_climate$pres)

obs.vip <- PPsA10x_climate[, c(3, 6:25)] 
  pres <- 1 
  v.start <- 2 
  v.stop <- ncol(obs.vip) 
  v.num <- v.stop - 1 
  dev.fit <- varimp.glm(obs.vip, obs.vip, pres, v.start, v.stop) 
dev.fit <- data.frame(dev.fit) 

d.max <- ceiling(signif(max(dev.fit[, 2]), 2) * 10)/10 
ylim.r <- range(0, d.max) 
x.labs <- names(obs.vip[2:v.stop])
```

```{r}
ggplot(dev.fit, aes(x = x.labs, y = X2)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = x.labs), stat = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(dev.fit[, 2])) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  xlab("Predictor Variable") + ylab("adj.D2") 
```

We can see from the graph that some climate variable has much greater predictive
power than others. I'll keep this in mine as I select which variables to retain
in subsequent analyses.

## Next steps

My next steps are to assess for correlations and predictor importance for the 
remaining three datasets. I'm leaning towards using the full state of South Dakota
for analyses purposes because there is greater variation between presence and
pseudo-absence locations which may better elucidate the differences between
where spotted skunks are more and less likely to occur. However, the choice of
ratio of P:PsAs to use was a little less clear. Therefore, I will analyze each
data set and use model accuracy metrics to determine the best choice.

Stay tuned!
